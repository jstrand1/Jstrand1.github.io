        <p>Hello Class. My name is Justin Strand. I currently go to school and work at CNM. 
            I have been working in tech for about two years, however this is my first attempt at 
            web design and or coding. I enjoy reading, learning, video games, camping, and spending
            time with my love ones. I recently got engaged. I also have a 7 year old daughter. Both
            are my whole world. Looking forward to learning with you all this semester.
        </p>
